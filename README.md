# ENIGMA Stganography & Compression
The new creative way to Compress &amp; Encrypt secret messages in an image

## Intro: 
Welcome to ENIGMA, a new creative way to send messages secretly, which raises no concern, 
by encryption of your data in an image that the human eye can't notice any difference.
This steganography method combines manipulation of jpeg compression algorithm for reducing file size and better encryption.
Steganography is the art and science of secret communication between two sides that attempt to hide the content of messages in an image. 

## Implementation:
The basic steganography proposed model is to iterate each pixel of an image and substitute the Least-significant bit (LSB) with the Most-significant bit (MSB) of the hidden data, in binary representation.

Our main idea of the project is to manipulate the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) portion of the JPEG process in order to embed secret data in the lossy compression procedure.
